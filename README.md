# Sentiment-Analysis
I am a movie buff. Movies are a major part of my very existence. 
Sometimes, I would like to know if a movie is good or bad. So, I am forced to read reviews. Although the main goal of a review is to tell us if a movie is good or bad, they don't do it straight. Some reviews are even 3 pages long and that is not the worst part. Almost all of them contain spoilers  :/
So, why not leave the reading part to someone else and just know if the movie is good or bad?
